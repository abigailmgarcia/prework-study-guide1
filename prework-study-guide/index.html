        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head elements contain information about the webpage</li>
          <li>Head elements are NOT visible to webpage user</li>
          <li>The body element represents visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements which work together to provide content and basic framework for webpage</li>
          <li>Usually composed of opening and closing angle brackets</li>
          <li>HTML elements are case sensitive</li>
          <li>Attributes define additional infor about element, ALWAYS definded in beginning element</li>

        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS gives content style such as: colors, aesthetics, visual layout, organization</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the OUTSIDE of elements</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content INSIDE an element</li>
          <li>3 ways to style using CSS: inline, internal style sheet, and most common and flexible external CSS stylesheet</li>
          <li>Inline styles element directly into HTML and apply to specific tag; useful for quick permanent changes. </li>
          <li>Internal Stylesheet is embedded directly into HTML file using style and head element</li>
          <li>External Stylesheet: perferred bc it allows developers to keep CSS rules in seperate file, making design changes easier</li>
          <li>We use link element to link external file sheets into HTML</li>
          <li>declarations contain two important components: "prop.: value;" </li>
          <li>ALWAYS add stylesheet to index.html</li>
          <li>Class attribute allows us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a selector</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in css can be done in many ways including, semantic references such as "color itself" or by referring to color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Every git command must start with "git"</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are working on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b "branch name": creates a new brnach and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add= adds modifications</li>
          <li>git commit: commits changes</li>
          <li>git pull: receive branch modifications and merge</li>
          <li>git push: pushes changes to feautre branch to Repo </li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Handles logic and allows users to interact with website</li>
          <li>.js file extension indicates that a file is JavaScript</li>
          <li>a variable is a named container, that allows us to store data in our code</li>
          <li>to declare a variable we use the keyword "var", then give it a unique name so we can reference the info sotred in the variable code</li>
          <li>example: var "name of container"= "data"; </li>
          <li>variables contain STRINGS of topics, all strings are contained in quotation marks</li>
          <li>each notes ends in a semicolon</li>
          <li>to access string you can just refer to variable topic</li>
          <li>link script.js within the body element</li>
          <li>console.log() to log variable to web console in browser</li>
          <li>control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JavaScript code runs from the first statement at the top down to the last statement at the bottom of page</li>
          <li>order of code counts, so be intentional!!</li>
          <li>one way to create a conditional statement is with an "if" statement</li>
          <li>If statements introduce decision making into code, only excuting IF the statement meets a condition or is true.</li>
          <li>A value is considered falsey if it is: 0,-0,On,"",null,undefinded,NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false</li>
          <li>more than one condition can be provided by using "else if"</li>
          <li>use === in each condition to check if two values are equal; the Boolean results will return true if equal or false if not</li>
          <li>Array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data that is related in some way</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful when performing a task on multiple pieces of data at once</li>
          <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of date, but instead can contain strings,numbers and so on</li>
          <li>arrays are accompanied with an index, index is a number value goes with each value in the array</li>
          <li>arrays are zero-indexed and sequential</li>
          <li>for loops can tell the computer to go through each of the values in the array on log them to the console until there are no values left</li>
          <li>in order to use for loop you need the values index and the arrays length, you can find the length by using a built in propery named "length"</li>
          <li>to comment out code is to make code inactive, without deleting; put /*and*/ before and after block of code.</li>
          <li>Functions do not automatically execute when JavaScript file is run, you must call function by name</li>
          <li>To create function in js file use "function"</li>
          <li>Use parenthesis after function name, when writing function</li>
          <li>To call a function we use the name of the function in JS file where we want the code to be executed</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
