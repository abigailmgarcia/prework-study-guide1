# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description


My motivation, and the reason why I built this project, was to create a clean and organized webpage with notes I (or other bootcamp students) can refer back to throughout my coding course. Throughout the process of creating this webpage, I learned about the basics for full-stack coding including topics on: JavaScript, Git, CSS, and HTML. As well as learning how to navigate through VS code, GitHub, and the Gitflow process. I have now gained basic coding skills, and have a webpage to resort to when I need to look back on the foundational topics.
